# 🐉 Dragon Knight 🐉

### Overview
**Dragon Knight** is a simple 2D auto-shooter created as a solo project for my **OOP course final** at **IT University** in January 2024. I worked on it throughout January, balancing development with other classes and part-time work.

I’m sharing it here for preservation, with the possibility of continuing development when I have more free time away from other university commitments and my part-time job.

### Future Plans
If I do revisit this project, I’d like to enhance it with:
- **Power-ups and Items**: Collectible power-ups, items, and new weapons.
- **XP System**: A leveling system where each level-up offers random modifiers, inspired by other auto-shooters like *Vampire Survivors*.
- **NPC Pet Dragon**: An NPC pet dragon that appears after a set time, offering interaction and rewards. Players could “head pat” the dragon to open a chest it carries, granting items or weapons.
- **Bug Fixes**: Improvements to hit/collision detection, particularly with the Tiled map's rectangle objects, to fix some known wonkiness.

### Usage
Feel free to use, modify, or build upon this code however you wish! A mention of where you found it would be appreciated. 😊
