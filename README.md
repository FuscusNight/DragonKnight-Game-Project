### Overview
**Dragon Knight** is a simple 2D auto-shooter created as a solo project for my **OOP course final** at **IT University** in January 2024. I worked on it throughout January, balancing development with other classes and part-time work.

I’m sharing it here for preservation, with the possibility of continuing development when I have more free time away from other university commitments and my part-time job plus my own interest to continue this.

Assets that were used is a mixture of free art assets found online and some AI Image Generator ones as my artistic skills are rather lacking.

## How to run :
# Open the project in IntellJ IDEA (or any other preffered coding software)
# Then simply start Lwjgl3Launcher

### Potential Future Plans 
If I do revisit this project, I’d like to enhance it with:
- **Power-ups and Items**: Collectible power-ups, items, and new weapons.
- **XP System**: A leveling system where each level-up offers random modifiers, inspired by other auto-shooters like *Vampire Survivors*.
- **NPC Pet Dragon**: An NPC pet dragon that appears after a set time, offering interaction and rewards. Players could “head pat” the dragon to open a chest it carries, granting items or weapons.
- **Bug Fixes**: Improvements to hit/collision detection, particularly with the Tiled map's rectangle objects, to fix some known wonkiness.

### Usage
Feel free to use, modify, or build upon this code however you wish! A mention of where you found it would be appreciated. 😊
