A simple 2D Auto-Shooter , it was made for a OOP course final in my IT University of January 2024. The project was a solo endeavor, worked on it for approx all of January as much as i could as other classes and work also existed that ate my time. 
I am uploading here for preservation sake, i might potentially work on this more once i am more free in the future and not burdoned with other University work or my part-time job.

If i do continue work on it, i wanted to add in pickuable power ups/items/weapon, an XP system that lets you pick a few random modifiers each level up similar to other Auto-Shooters like Vampire Surviors and implement an NPC pet dragon that spawns after a set time 
that the player could give head pats to and in return the chest the dragon carries would open up and reward the player with a new item/weapon.
+ fix bugs , specifically related to some wonkiness happening with my hit detections.

Feel free to use the code, modify it and do whatever you'd like with it if you so desire to use it. Just mention where you got it from would be appriciated .
